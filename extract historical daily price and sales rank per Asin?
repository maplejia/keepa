New to python and mostly to convert code to reslove my problem.

Does anyone know working code for extract historical daily price and sales rank per Asin?
I have purchase keepa API and try to copy some code from github, but now working.
for example, I would like to get historical daily price and sales rank for 'B014EKQ5AA'? my ideal output will include date, price and sales rank?
any one know it? thank you very much.

here is my code:

import keepa
import logging
import inspect
logging.basicConfig()
import datetime
import requests
import numpy as np
accesskey = 'xxx' # enter real access key here
api = keepa.Keepa(accesskey)
asins = ['B014EKQ5AA']
asins = np.asarray(['B014EKQ5AA'])
products = api.query(asins)
product = products[0]

for x in range(len(asins)):
    print('ASIN is ' + products[x]['asin'])
    print ('Title is ' + products[x]['title'])
key = 'SALES'

history = product['data']
print(history[key][-1])
# sales rank array (and time) can be obtained with:
sales_dt = history['%s_time' % key]
sales = history[key]

# plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.step(sales_dt, sales, where='pre')
plt.show()


output is blank
